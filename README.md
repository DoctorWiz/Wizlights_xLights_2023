# Wizlights_xLights_2023
Doctor Wizard's Giant Musical Holiday Light Show xLights files for 2023

I am sharing these sequences [almost] freely to anyone who wants to use them under a general public license.
BUT I ask that if you use one or more of them that you please make a donation of $10 or more to the xLights
project, or to any animal (wild or pet) or nature related charity.
Examples, ASPCA, Humane Society, Save the Whales, Audibon Society, Sierra Fund, or your local animal shelter.
Sorry, human related charities do not count.

Under the rules of a general public license I cannot force you to do this (nor would I want to force you) so
I am counting on you to be honest and do the right thing and make a contribution.

Thank you!
Doctor Wizard
