Doctor Wizard's Giant Musical Holiday Light Show xLights files for 2023

These files are copyrighted 2023+ by Doctor Wizard and Doctor Wizard's Giant Musical Holiday Light 
Show (Wizlights for short)

I am sharing these sequences [almost] freely to anyone who wants to use them under a general public license.
BUT I ask that if you use one or more of them that you please make a voluntary donation of $10 or more to 
the xLights project, or to any animal (wild or pet) or nature related charity.
Examples, ASPCA, Humane Society, Save the Whales, Audibon Society, Sierra Fund, or your local animal shelter.
Sorry, human related charities do not count.

Under the terms of a general public license I cannot force you to do this (nor would I want to force you) so
I am counting on you to be honest and do the right thing and make a contribution.

Thank you!
Doctor Wizard
