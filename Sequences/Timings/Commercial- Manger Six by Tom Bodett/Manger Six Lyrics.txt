Hi, this is Tom Bodett for Manger Six.
We know you have been traveling a lot this holiday season and you've probably been told there is no room at the Inn.
Well, that's just not the case here at Manger Six.
Why, for just 29 drachma we'll put you up in a warm comfortable stable with plenty of fresh milk for the newborn.
There's even individual stalls for your mules, camels, or what ever happen to be drivin' across the desert.
And in case unexpected visitors drop in on ya; Shepherds, Wise Men, holy ghosts. It's not a problem at Manger Six.
There is plenty of Frankincense and Myrrh to go around.
This is Tom Bodett for Manger Six remindin' ya there's always room in this Inn.
We'll even keep a star out for ya.
